# WTCK (What to Cook)

## About the project

The project purpose is to make a platform, that take input about cooking from the user (ingridiend, for exapmle) and call 3rd-party API TheMealDB to present response to the user. At the moment, user can get recipes, based on the main ingridient, or random recipe.
User can sign up/log in, for that part I'm using my backend. After logging the user will be able to like recipes, adding them to his personal collection, or create a new recipe to himself, for a private usage, at the moment.
