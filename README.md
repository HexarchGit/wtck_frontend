# WTCK (What to Cook)

## About the project

The projects purpose is to make a platform that can take input from the user, ingridiend at that moment (or search random meal) and call 3rd-party API TheMealDB to the data and present it to the user.
User can sign up/log in, that's holding on my own backend. After logging the user will be able to like recipes, wich will add them to his personal favorites list.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: For work with TheMealDB API needed my backend as a proxy server because of their CROS settings. For local testing, please, use backend repository.
